# Sigha — Design Document

## 1. Overview

Sigha (Arabic for "formula") is a free, entirely client-side web tool for working with
Salesforce formulas. Users paste or write a formula and get: instant syntax and semantic error
highlighting, a simulation panel that detects field references and lets them supply values to
compute a result, boolean logic simplification with step-by-step explanation, canonical
reformatting, and lint findings. The tool is free and open source: it must load instantly,
feel expert-grade, and never give a confidently wrong answer.

The emphasis is the full debugger experience, not evaluation alone — editor-grade positioned
diagnostics with error recovery, comment-preserving formatting, linting, step-by-step
simplification, correct blank-handling semantics, and shareable permalinks.

### Goals

- Sub-second first load; sub-frame feedback on every keystroke.
- Correct-or-refuse simulation: every simulated answer is defensible; everything else is an
  explicit "unsupported."
- Support every standard-formula-engine context (see §5) from day one via configuration.
- Produce a durable golden test corpus that outlives this codebase.
- Shareable permalinks (formula + inputs encoded in URL hash) as the growth mechanism.

### Non-goals

- Report formulas (row-level / custom summary; `AMOUNT:SUM` syntax) — a different language.
- Org connectivity of any kind (OAuth, metadata fetch, live evaluation against an org).
- Server-side components, accounts, persistence beyond the URL hash.
- Simulating org-state-dependent functions (see §7 exclusion list).
- Exact compiled-size computation (approximate warning only).

## 2. Architecture

Six layers with strictly downward dependencies:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ui/         React + CodeMirror 6                           │
│             editor · simulation form · results · panels    │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ features/   simplifier · formatter · linter ·              │
│             field extraction                               │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ analysis/   type checker · context validator · diagnostics │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ engine/     evaluator · value domain (decimal.js)          │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ registry/   function metadata table · context configs      │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ syntax/     lexer · parser · AST · spans · comments        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Two leaf modules sit beside the stack, importable by every layer: `i18n/` (all user-facing
strings; see `src/i18n/README.md`) and `theme/` (branding — product name, palette, fonts).

Formulas are tiny (≤ ~5KB source), so there is no incremental parsing: every keystroke triggers
a full lex + parse + analyze pass, which is microseconds. Simplicity over cleverness throughout.

## 3. Syntax layer

### 3.1 Lexer

Hand-written scanner producing a flat token stream with spans. Token kinds: identifiers
(including dotted paths and `$Global.Path` references as single tokens or trivially joinable
sequences — parser's choice, but dotted paths end up as one AST reference), string literals
(single and double quoted), number literals, operators (`+ - * / ^ & = <> < <= > >= == != && ||`),
punctuation, and trivia (whitespace, `/* */` comments, and a third kind, invisible). Trivia is
retained and attached to tokens (leading/trailing) so the formatter can preserve comments.
Lexing never fails: unknown characters become error tokens with diagnostics, and highlighting
is driven purely by the token stream so it works even when parsing fails.

Pasted formulas routinely carry non-ASCII passengers — Salesforce's own help pages embed a
zero-width space (U+200B) in sample formula text — so the lexer treats two families specially
rather than failing outright. Invisible and non-standard-whitespace characters (Unicode Cf/Cc
format and control code points; Zs/Zl/Zp spaces beyond the ASCII space) lex as the third trivia
kind, "invisible", so the surrounding formula still parses; each maximal run of identical
characters produces one error diagnostic, coded "invisible-character" for format/control code
points or "nonstandard-whitespace" for non-ASCII spaces. Typographic confusables — curly
quotes, en/em dashes, `×`, `÷`, fullwidth punctuation — stay error tokens (they are visible and
change the formula's apparent meaning, so they are not silently absorbed as trivia), coded
"confusable-character". A run of smart-quoted text (`“abc”`) lexes as a single string token
plus one "confusable-character" diagnostic rather than splitting on the curly quotes.

Diagnostics may carry an optional machine-applicable fix: a title plus a list of non-overlapping
text edits against the original source. The invisible/nonstandard-whitespace diagnostics fix by
deleting or replacing with a regular space, the confusable-character diagnostics fix by
substituting the ASCII equivalent, and the smart-quote diagnostic's fix straightens both quotes
at once. Every fix is offered in the Problems panel, individually and as a fix-all that applies
them in a single edit — the invariant that fixes of distinct diagnostics never overlap is what
makes the batch safe, and the diagnostic pipeline enforces it across producers by dropping the
larger of two fixes that would collide. A fix that changes what the formula evaluates to rather
than only how it is written (removing an invisible character from inside a string literal) is
flagged as such and excluded from the fix-all, never from its own button. Nothing about the fix
mechanism is specific to this character class — the analysis layer's `nonstandard-operator`
findings use it too.

Reserved-word handling: there are no reserved identifier prefixes. `Null_Check__c`,
`TRUEFIELD__c`, etc. must lex and parse as identifiers. Keywords (`TRUE`, `FALSE`, `NULL`) are
recognized only as complete case-insensitive tokens.

### 3.2 Parser

Recursive descent with Pratt-style precedence for binary operators. The precedence table is
transcribed from Salesforce's own open-source grammar and org-verified where the grammar alone
couldn't settle product behavior (see CONFORMANCE.md). Tightest to loosest: parentheses; unary
`-`/`NOT`; `* /`; `^`; `+ - &`; comparisons (`< <= > >=`); equality (`= <> == !=`); `&&`; `||`
— all left-associative. Two org-confirmed surprises: `* /` binds tighter than `^`, and `^` is
left-associative — both invert the usual math conventions. `&&`, `||`, `==`, and `!=` are
documented, org-verified product operators (`==`/`!=` are interchangeable with `=`/`<>`); we
parse and evaluate them and flag each use with a stylistic `nonstandard-operator` warning
steering toward the conventional `AND()`/`OR()`/`=`/`<>` forms. The outermost operator of a nest
carries a fix that rewrites the whole subtree into those forms, splicing original source text
rather than reprinting the AST (which would drop comments) — and withholding the fix outright
when the rewrite cannot be made without swallowing one.

**Error recovery is the defining requirement.** Strategy:

- Synchronization points: on error, skip to the nearest `,`, `)`, or EOF depending on context.
- Missing-token insertion: unclosed parens/quotes produce a synthetic close with a diagnostic,
  allowing the subtree to complete.
- Error nodes: unparseable regions become `ErrorNode` AST leaves covering their span; downstream
  passes treat them as unknown-typed opaque values and suppress cascading diagnostics inside
  them.
- The parser returns `{ ast, diagnostics[] }` — always both, never throws.

### 3.3 AST

Discriminated-union node types: `NumberLit`, `StringLit`, `BooleanLit`, `NullLit`, `FieldRef`
(full dotted path as one node, flagged `$`-global vs plain), `FunctionCall`, `BinaryOp`,
`UnaryOp`, `Paren` (preserved for formatting fidelity), `ErrorNode`. Every node: `span`,
optional attached comments (leading/trailing). AST is immutable; transformations return new
trees. Exhaustive-switch discipline (`never` checks) so new node kinds fail compilation anywhere
unhandled.

## 4. Registry

The semantic single source of truth. One typed data table, one entry per function:

```ts
interface FunctionSpec {
  name: string; // canonical uppercase
  params: ParamSpec[]; // types, variadic flags, min/max arity
  returnType: TypeRule; // fixed type or rule (e.g. SameAsArg(0))
  contexts: ContextId[] | "all"; // where Salesforce allows it
  simulatable: boolean; // false ⇒ hard "unsupported" in simulation
  evalImpl?: EvalFn; // required iff simulatable
  docsUrl: string;
  summary: string; // hover text
  lintNotes?: LintNote[];
}
```

This table drives autocomplete, hover docs, arity/type diagnostics, context-availability
diagnostics ("VLOOKUP is not available in flow formulas"), the simulation boundary, and
evaluation dispatch. A registry self-consistency test validates every entry (simulatable ⇒
evalImpl present, context ids exist, etc.).

Function implementations and their tests are ported from
[formulon](https://github.com/leifg/formulon) — a pre-existing MIT-licensed JavaScript
implementation of the Salesforce formula language, credited in `NOTICE` — fixing its known
defects along the way (blank arithmetic, comments, reserved-prefix identifiers, div-by-zero,
positionless errors) per CLAUDE.md's porting notes. Where formulon appears elsewhere in these
docs, it is as this seed baseline; it ranks below Salesforce's own engine and org verification
in the trust order (CONFORMANCE.md).

## 5. Formula contexts

Contexts are pure configuration:

```ts
interface FormulaContext {
  id: string; // "formula_field", "validation_rule", ...
  label: string;
  tier: 1 | 2; // verification status (see below)
  globals: GlobalSpec[]; // $Record? $User? $Flow? $Api? $System? ...
  requiredReturnType?: SfType; // e.g. Boolean for validation rules
  blankModeToggle: boolean; // formula fields: yes; others per-verified behavior
  charLimit?: number; // source-length lint threshold
  notes?: string; // shown in UI, e.g. Tier 2 disclaimer
}
```

Shipped contexts (all standard-formula-engine contexts, day one):

- **Tier 1 (org-verified availability data):** formula field, validation rule, flow formula,
  default value, workflow rule, workflow field update, approval process entry/step, custom
  button/link, quick action predefined value — every context whose metadata container
  compile-checks formulas (verification recorded in `VERIFICATION.md`).
- **Tier 2 (best-effort config, visibly labeled "availability data unverified for this
  context"):** email template merge context — its metadata container never compile-checks
  merge formulas at deploy, so availability there is structurally unverifiable.

Tier is a data field; promoting a context to Tier 1 is a config change backed by verification
work recorded in `VERIFICATION.md`. Report formulas are structurally excluded (different
grammar), stated in the UI's context picker as "not supported."

## 6. Type system and analysis

Types: `Text`, `Number`, `Currency`, `Percent`, `Boolean`, `Date`, `Datetime`, `Time`,
`Picklist`, `Multipicklist`, `Id`, plus `Unknown` (for error nodes and undetermined fields).
Blankness is a value-level state, not a type.

The checker walks the AST with the registry: operator/param type agreement, arity, return-type
requirement of the active context, function availability in the active context. `Unknown`
unifies with anything (no cascading noise). Diagnostics carry severity (error/warning/info),
span, message, and optional quick-fix hint.

**Field type inference** (for the simulation form): field references get candidate types from
usage — argument positions (`DATEVALUE(x)` ⇒ x: Text; `ISPICKVAL(x, …)` ⇒ x: Picklist), operator
contexts (`x > 5` ⇒ Number-ish), and cross-constraint propagation. Ambiguities surface as a type
picker in the UI rather than a guess. Conflicting constraints produce a diagnostic ("Name is
used as both Text and Number").

## 7. Evaluator

Interprets the AST over a Salesforce value domain:

- `SfValue = { type: SfType, blank: boolean, data?: Decimal | string | boolean | DateParts | … }`
- All numeric math via decimal.js; round-half-up.
- **Blank-handling mode** (`"zero" | "blank"`) is an evaluator parameter, surfaced as a UI
  toggle for contexts where it applies. It governs arithmetic with blank numeric operands.
- Blank rules: text concat treats blank as empty; null checkbox coerces to `false`;
  ISBLANK/ISNULL per their real semantics; comparisons/blank interactions follow the golden
  corpus, not intuition.
- Runtime failures that Salesforce itself surfaces (division by zero) produce a simulated
  `#Error!` result object — rendered distinctly in the UI as "Salesforce would show #Error!
  here," which is itself useful debugger output.
- **Simulation boundary:** encountering a non-`simulatable` function halts evaluation with
  `UnsupportedError{functionName, span}`. No partial or default results. Excluded from
  simulation (but fully supported for parsing/highlighting/formatting/linting): `PRIORVALUE`,
  `ISCHANGED`, `ISNEW`, `ISCLONE`, `VLOOKUP`, `IMAGE`, `GETSESSIONID`, `CURRENCYRATE`, and
  resolution of org-state globals (`$CustomMetadata`, `$Setup`, `$Permission`,
  `$ObjectType`…). The registry's `simulatable` flag, not this list, is the source of truth —
  other functions also refuse where a faithful client-side value is impossible (e.g. the
  transcendentals, `REGEX`, `CASESAFEID`), each with its rationale in `VERIFICATION.md`.
  `$User`, `$Profile`, and similar simple-record globals are simulatable as user-fillable
  field groups like `$Record`.

## 8. Features

### 8.1 Field extraction & simulation form

An AST walk collects unique field references (plain fields, `$Record.X`, dotted paths as flat
keys, fillable globals). Each becomes a form input whose widget matches its inferred/selected
type (text input, decimal input, date picker, checkbox, picklist free-text) with an explicit
**Blank** toggle per field — null vs empty vs zero is where formulas bite, so blankness is a
first-class input state. Values and the blank-mode toggle feed the evaluator; results update
live. Below the result, a collapsed-by-default "Steps" section renders the evaluator's
sub-expression trace as a tree over the AST: every evaluated field reference, operator, and
function call alongside its value, for the debugger feel. The tree mirrors the evaluator's own
short-circuiting exactly — a branch AND/OR/IF/CASE or `&&`/`||` never reached (the losing side of
an `IF`, an `AND` argument past the first `FALSE`, a `CASE` `when`/`then` pair after the match)
renders as "not evaluated" rather than a guessed or blank value. The trace comes from a single
hook in the evaluator's recursive walker (`EvalEnv.trace`), so it costs nothing beyond an
optional callback when unused and needs no separate interpreter.

### 8.2 Boolean simplifier

Pipeline of independent AST rewrite rules, each `(node) => node | null` with a name and a
human-readable description: constant folding, identity/annihilator laws, double negation,
De Morgan, absorption, `IF(x, TRUE, FALSE)` → `x`, `IF(x, y, IF(z, …))` chains → `CASE`
suggestion, redundant parens. Applied to fixpoint with a step log; the UI renders the log as a
step-by-step transformation (each step: rule name, before → after) — trust-building and
shareable. Every rule must be blank-safe (equivalence-preserving under Salesforce blank
semantics, not just classical boolean algebra); each rule ships with
property-test coverage comparing original vs rewritten over randomized inputs including blanks
under both blank modes. Rules that can't be made blank-safe are demoted to _suggestions_
("equivalent if X is never blank") rather than applied rewrites.

### 8.3 Formatter

Pretty-printer over the AST: canonical indentation for nested calls, argument alignment,
operator spacing, comment preservation in position (leading/trailing attachment), `Paren` nodes
preserved. Configurable only minimally (indent width). Property-tested for idempotence and
reparse-equality.

### 8.4 Linter

Registry- and AST-driven rules, each with id, severity, span, message, docs link:

- Hardcoded 15/18-char record IDs (regex on string literals with ID shape).
- Nested `IF` depth over threshold ⇒ suggest CASE/simplifier.
- Comparison of picklist via `TEXT()` where `ISPICKVAL` is idiomatic.
- Deprecated / discouraged constructs (registry `lintNotes`).
- Source length vs context `charLimit`, with explicit "compiled size differs and cannot be
  computed exactly" phrasing.
- Function-availability and return-type findings from the analysis layer surface in the same
  panel.

### 8.5 Permalinks

`lz-string` compressToEncodedURIComponent of
`{ v: 1, context, formula, fields: {name: {type, blank, value}}, blankMode }` in the URL hash.
Decoded on load; version field for forward compatibility. This is the sharing/growth mechanism —
the "Copy link" affordance should be prominent next to results.

## 9. UI

Single-page layout: context picker (with Tier 2 disclaimer where applicable) → CodeMirror editor
(highlighting, inline squiggles, hover docs, autocomplete) → tabbed or stacked panels:
**Simulate** (field form + result + blank-mode toggle), **Problems** (diagnostics + lint, each
fixable finding with its own Fix button and a fix-all in the panel header — the only place
automatic fixes are applied from), **Simplify** (step log + apply button), **Format** (one-click,
in-editor). Mobile-usable but desktop-first. Errors and empty states follow direction-not-mood
copy. Visual design follows the "calibrated instrument" direction; product name, palette, and any
cross-linking live in one theme module (`src/theme/`) so branding changes stay a one-file change.
The tool is hosted at `sigha.app`.

## 10. Testing & conformance

- **Golden corpus** (`corpus/*.json`): `(formula, context, inputs, blankMode, expected)` rows.
  Sources, in trust order: real-org verification (authoritative), salesforce/formula-engine
  oracle output, formulon's adapted tests (the seed — see §4). The corpus is the project's
  durable asset — language-agnostic, reusable by any future implementation.
- **Conformance number** (corpus pass rate) reported in CI; it is the project's headline metric.
- **Property tests** (fast-check): formatter idempotence + reparse-equality; simplifier
  equivalence incl. blanks/modes; lexer round-trip.
- **Error-recovery suite:** malformed inputs asserting diagnostic count/positions/messages and
  recovered-AST shape.
- **VERIFICATION.md** is the verification ledger: every behavioral claim about Salesforce
  semantics with its status (org-verified with probe id, oracle-verified, or open), plus the
  remaining open questions. No claim ships as "supported" without an entry there.

## 11. Build order

The layers were built bottom-up, mirroring the dependency direction in §2: the syntax pipeline
first (lexer → error-recovering parser → AST → CodeMirror integration), then analysis and
context configuration, then the evaluator (value domain, formulon port with fixes, simulation
boundary, golden corpus in CI), then the AST-consuming features (formatter, linter, simplifier,
permalinks), and finally the oracle conformance work and visual design. Contributors extending
the tool should follow the same discipline: semantics land in the corpus before they land in
code.
